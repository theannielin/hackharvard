###Notes:
The original application was developed as a submission for the inaugural HackHarvard in November 2015. It used the third party tool, markovify. After the hackathon, Annie Lin and Joanne Koong used the UI framework to supplement their CS182: Artificial Intelligence final project, replacing markovify with their own Markov chain method. They also experimented with other AI text generation approaches, comparing and gathering statistics on efficiency and linguistic correctness.
